# Multivariate Gaussian Esimation Maximisation   
The following is an implemenation of Multivariate Gaussian Micture Models, estimation maximisation algorithm. The following code has been written in Pytorch to enable maximum memory efficiency and fast processing. 

We run the following on data which have taken, consists of 500 dimensions Gaussians.
