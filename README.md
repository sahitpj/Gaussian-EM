# Multivariate Gaussian Estimation Maximisation   
The following is an implemenation of Multivariate Gaussian Mixture Models, estimation maximisation algorithm, written using Pytorch.

for a demo, run the `demo.py` file.

In order to visualise the algorithm, run the `visualise.py` file

The config files can be over-written to generate a Gaussian mixture model file of different parameters. Data pressnt is in the form of numpy txt files.
